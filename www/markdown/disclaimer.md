Whilst every effort has been taken during the development of this tool/model for it to be as accurate and reliable as possible it is important that the user understands that the outputs are a prediction based on the assumptions chosen through the input parameter values. In view of the current uncertainty on the COVID-19 mechanisms of action, the output of the model should be used to explore multiple scenarios and in combination with a larger evidence base during decision-making.

The appropriate use of this tool/model and its output can contribute to effective policymaking, but misuse or misinterpretation of the output can mislead decision-making. Any decisions taken whist using these tools are the responsibility of the user and no liability whatsoever will be taken by the developers/authors of the tool.
